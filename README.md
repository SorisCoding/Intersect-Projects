<h1> Intersect Projects </h1>

This page is for any and all Intersect Projects or Intersect Side Projects (some projects might have their own dedicated repo and you will be able to find their links here).

<h2>Current Projects in Development:</h2>

    ~ Intersect Engine V2

    ~ PyAPI Minecraft Mod
 
<h2>Projects Planned:</h2>


    ~ Modularity PyAPI Mod

    ~ Intersect V2


<h3>PyAPI</h3> 

PyAPI is a Minecraft mod that will be designed to make modding much easier in theory,
plus overcome the shortcomings of modding limitations,
such as more efficient CPU usage and running the mod outside Minecraft.
The way this will work is by running an app at the same time as Minecraft and the PyAPI mod will connect to said app. 
When that happens, the app will handle all the processing of the mod itself and will only tell Minecraft what to do.

This mod is still mostly a concept,
but it will hopefully make modding easier and allow for better, more cool mods in the future.

<h3>Modularity</h3>

Modularity will run on the PyAPI app as its first python mod, its more of a demonstration mod on what PyAPI can do.
Modularity will be a networking and redstone mod, taking inspiration from ComputerCraft and Project:
Red, hopefully Modularity will fix and improve upon the shortcomings of the current network and redstone mods,
and it can do so due to PyAPI.
It won't be as realistic as CC and Project:
Red but will hopefully be one of the most efficient and useful networking and redstone mods out there.

<h3>Intersect V2</h3>

Intersect is a multipurpose platform for any tools I'm making. 
You probably noticed the "V2" on most Intersect things, 
and that is because the first version of Intersect was private use only between me and my friend.
The reason I'm making a second version is because I wasn't happy with how it looked,
it ran just straight off of the terminal it was running it, same with its GUI.
Intersect V2 will run off of Intersect Engine V2, hence the name
(that's a second version because I messed up the first so much I had to redo it all)

<h3> Intersect Engine V2</h3>

Intersect Engine V2 is as exactly as it sounds, it will be an application engine for my projects, not too exciting.
I just thought it would be neat and cool if I made my own engine,
thinking it would be easier than already existing python packages (which it was NOT).
The good part of having a dedicated engine is that it's easy to change how it behaves,
and I will be making it game dev friendly for future scenarios

<h3>End Note</h3>

Any projects here, past, present, and future, are all developed by me, a singular person that codes as a hobby,
meaning,
use these programs at your own discretion since I can NOT guarantee that they will work or won't break something.

I do not mind if you use my projects or adapt them into their own thing,
just please make sure to credit me and make a clear distinction between my project and yours.

If you have any suggestions or want to contribute to certain projects, please just ask me on discord (soriscode).
Just don't expect much since I'm not used to working with other people.

(dear god this README is long and boring, thanks if you read it all :3)
